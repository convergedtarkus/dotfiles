# What These Are
These are small javascript functions/code that can be run from a bookmark to perform bulk operations or simple view modifications to Github pages.

# How To Use
Run the makeBookmark.bash script, give it an input of one of the scripts and copy the output.
```
./makeBookmark.bash ./widescreen.js | pbcopy
```

Make a new bookmark in Chrome (though this should work for any browser) and for the URL of the bookmark, paste in the Javascript code. You can then click the bookmark to run the Javascript code.
