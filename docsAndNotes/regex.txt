## Shorthand Character Classes
	\d = Digits
	\w = Word Character [A-Za-z0-9_]
	\s = Whitespace character [ \t\r\n\f] (Generally)

	Negate a character class with ^ or capatalize
		^\d or \D
		The ^ works for characters as well like ^T would match anything but a capital T etc.

## Capture groups
	() to capture the content inside
		(?:) makes a non-capturing group. Helpful for just grouping or optimization.
	
	Reference with \1 \2 etc (Some systems use/support $1 $1 etc)

	Generally used for replace, but can be used in a regex to match and exact characters.
		`(\w+?) \1` matches 'Dog Dog` but not 'Dog Cat'

## Negative Lookahead
	(?!A)
	Not support in some basic systems.
